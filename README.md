SquishIt.S3
===========

SquishIt integration with Amazon S3.

Currently SquishIt only supports using custom renderers in release mode, so it will render all files locally when debugging.

For usage instructions see the [introductory blog post](http://blogs.lessthandot.com/index.php/WebDev/ServerProgramming/making-squishit-work-with-amazon) for now.
